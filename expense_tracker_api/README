# Expense Tracker API

This is a simple API for managing personal expenses. It provides endpoints for user authorization, creating new transactions, getting user balance and getting transactions history.

## Endpoints

### User authorization
* `POST /auth`: Creates a new user if it doesn't exist or logs in existing user. Body should contain `username` and `password` fields.

### Transactions

* `POST /transactions`: Creates a new transaction. Body should contain `amount`, `type` (either "income" or "outcome"), `note` and `tag` fields.
* `GET /transactions`: Returns a list of all transactions for the current user. List is split into two parts: `income` and `outcome`.

### Balance

* `GET /balance`: Returns current balance for the current user.

## Authentication
API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. After successful `POST /auth` request, API returns a JWT token in `Set-Cookie` header. This token is stored in the `Authorization` cookie and is used for all subsequent requests.

## Environment variables

API uses the following environment variables:

* `SECRET_KEY_FOR_JWT`: Secret key for JWT token generation.
* `SECRET_KEY_FOR_AES`: Secret key for AES encryption.
* `EXPIRED_TIME_FOR_JWT`: Time in seconds for JWT token to expire.
* `EXPIRED_TIME_FOR_REFRESH`: Time in seconds for refresh token to expire.
* `KEY_FOR_COOKIE`: Key for cookie encryption.

## Database

API uses SQLite as a database. Database file is located in the `wallet.db` file in the root of the project.
